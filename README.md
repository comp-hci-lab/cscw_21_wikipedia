# cscw_21_wikipedia

The datasets folder contains the sentences for the three tasks extracted from
Wikipedia. These tasks correspond to "citations", "point-of-view", and
"clarifications". Each row of the dataset files contain a Wikipedia sentence, a
weakly extracted label for the specific task ('1' if the sentence needs the improvement, '0' otherwise), 
section name, and additionally the Wikipedia revision from which the sentence is extracted. 

Please cite the work if using the dataset
